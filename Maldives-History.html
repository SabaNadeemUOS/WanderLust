            <h2>Overview History of Maldives</h2>
            <p>
                The Maldives (formerly called the Maldive Islands) were first settled in the 5th century B.C. by Buddhist seafarers from India and Sri Lanka. 
                According to tradition, Islam was adopted in 1153. Originally, the islands were under the suzerainty of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). 
                They came under British protection in 1887 and were a dependency of then-colony Ceylon until 1948. 
                An independence agreement with Britain was signed July 26, 1965. For centuries a sultanate,
                the islands adopted a republican form of government in 1952, but the sultanate was restored in 1954.
                In 1968, however, as the result of a referendum, a republic was again established in the recently independent country. 
                Ibrahim Nasir, the authoritarian president since 1968, was removed from office and replaced by the more progressive 
                Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in 1978. Gayoom was elected to a sixth five-year term in 2003.

            <h2>About the people</h2>
            <p>
                he population of Maldives belongs almost entirely to the Maldivian ethnic group, which is the result of various peoples
                settling in the islands successively through the country’s history. The first settlers, it is generally believed,
                were Tamil and Sinhalese peoples from southern India and Sri Lanka. Traders from Arab countries, Malaya, Madagascar,Indonesia, and China visited the islands through the centuries.
                The official language is an Indo-European language called Dhivehi (or Maldivian); Arabic, Hindi, and English are also spoken. Islam is the state religion.

            <p>
                The Maldivian rufiyaa is the currency of the Maldives.
                The issuance of the currency is controlled by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA).
                The most commonly used symbols for the rufiyaa are MVR and Rf. The ISO 4217 code for Maldivian rufiyaa is MVR.
                The rufiyaa is subdivided into 100 laari.The name "rufiyaa" is derived from the Sanskrit.
                The midpoint of exchange rate is Rf. 12/85 per US dollar and the rate is permitted to fluctuate within a ±20% band, i.e.
                between Rf. 10/28 and Rf. 15/42 as of 10 April 2017.
