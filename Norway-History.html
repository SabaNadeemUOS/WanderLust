           <h2>Overview History of Norway</h2>
            <p>
                People began settling in Norway very early - in 9000 BC, in fact. This was after the end of the first ice age, so it was now an inhabitable location. Settlers survived by hunting and fishing animals such as seal, deer, elk and whales.
                 Farming didn't become prominent until 500 BC, which was known as the bronze age. This time period got its name from the various weapons and jewelry created.
                Norway didn't achieve full independence until 1905 when Haakon VII was crowned the King of Norway. Before then, the country was a dependency under Denmark until 1814, then it entered into a new union with Sweden. Not shortly after Norway's official independence, women were given the right to vote in local elections in 1907, then in national elections in 1913.

            <h2>About the people</h2>
            <p>
                Norwegians are a north Germanic ethnic group and nation native to Norway, where they form the vast majority of the population. They share a common culture and speak the Norwegian language. 
                Along with Swedish and Danish, Norwegian forms a dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible local and regional varieties.

            <p>
                The krone is currency of the Kingdom of Norway (including Svalbard). Traditionally known as the Norwegian crown in English
                The krone was the thirteenth-most-traded currency in the world by value in April 2010, down three positions from 2007.
