                <dd>When choosing a vacation place, the weather must be taken into consideration.
                     You could choose to go during spring break in order to avoid the months that
                      are particularly hot and cold.</dd></dl></li>

                    <dd>Why not make it happen if, for example, you've always wanted to visit Europe?
                         Don't put off travelling as you'll never know when the 
                         journey will come to an end.</dd></dl></li>

                <dd>It's usually on my list of things to do to visit new places I've never gone.
                    We have a tendency to return to the locations we have enjoyed in the past, but taking a chance on the unknown can be incredibly rewarding.
